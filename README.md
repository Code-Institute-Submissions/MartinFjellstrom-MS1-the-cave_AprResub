Tomato rgb(254,87,57)        (IMG)

Darkslaegrey rgb(32, 42, 37)    (IMG)

Slategrey rgb(89, 131, 129)     (IMG)
      
### Fonts

The main fonts used throughout the site are [Jura](https://fonts.google.com/?query=jura) and [Black Ops One](https://fonts.google.com/?query=black+ops+one) with Serif 
as a fallback font should the font not be supported by the user’s browser. The fonts were chosen to give an alternative, sporty and modern feel which is pleasing to the users and potential customers of the climbing gym. 

### Imagery

There are hero images on most of the site pages in order to grab user’s attention and give a sporty feel to the site overall. On the home page the image carousel is there to give users an idea of what the gym looks like. Pictures are included throughout to give a modern and colourful vibe.

## Compatibility Testing

### The site was tested in the following browsers:

* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/)

* [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)

* [Opera](https://www.opera.com/)

* [Chrome](https://www.google.se/chrome/)

### [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) was used to test responsiveness on the following devices:

* **Desktop** 1600x992px

* **Laptop** 1280x802px

* **Tablet** 768x1024px

* **Mobile** 320x480px

## Bugs

1. On Firefox browser the items in the dropdown options in the course booking form do not show in the correct font (Jura)

    **Fix:** I wrote a Mozilla specific extension in the css file that targeted the options in the dropdown menu

        @-moz-document url-prefix() {
        .form-select option {
        font-family: 'jura', serif;
        }
        }

2. On Firefox browser the table in the “Entry Fee” card in the “Prices” section of the landing page is centred rather than aligned to the top of the card.

    **Fix:** I wrote a Mozilla specific extension in the css file that targeted the .entry-fee-table and gave it a top margin.

        @-moz-document url-prefix() {
        .entry-fee-table {
        margin-top: 10px;
        }
        }

3. On a mobile device (320x480px) the boxed headings (competitions, the team, courses) push the size of screen out more than other content on the page, creating a white gap on the right side of all pages.

    **Fix:** I removed the side paddings on the .who-we-are selector in the css file which pushed the "The Team" boxed heading to the right.

        .who-we-are {
        padding: 50px 0px;
        background-color: rgb(89, 131, 129);
        }

    I took the course boxed heading out of the course-text div which has a specified width that pushed the box to the right

    I took the competition boxed heading out of the about-comp div which has a specified width that pushed the box to the right

4. On a mobile device (320x480px) “The Cave” heading on the landing page is overlapping the navigation bar.

    **Fix:** I wrote a media query for max-height and changed the font size to 5rem so the heading doesn't overlapp the navbar

        @media (max-height: 550px) {
        .welcome-text {
        font-size: 5rem;
        }
        }

5. On tablet device one one of the collapse buttons on the competitions page is a different height to the others.

    **Fix:** I added some extra space inbetween the text and the icon on the buttons

        Top Rope Competition 02/10/2020 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-arrow-down"></i>

6. On all devices there is a white gap on the right side of the landing page.

    **Fix:** Inspected the applied CSS in dev tools and toggled the values in the rules view, unchecking the checkboxes to find which property caused the bug. Found a bootstrap property was the cause of the bug and consequently set the value to 0 which fixed it.


        .row {
        --bs-gutter-x: 0rem;
        }

## Code 

**Navigation bar** - For the creation of the navigation bar I was inspired by “Bootstrapping Your Next Big Idea With Bootstrap 4 - Components - Core Components - part 1” Code Institute lesson.

[Bootstrap V.5](https://getbootstrap.com/) Template code from the Bootstrap documentation was used 
to create the navbar, cards, modals, tables, collapse buttons and the carousel.

[Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-started) – Used for the embedded map on the contact page.
